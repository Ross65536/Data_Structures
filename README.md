# Data_Structures
Some data structures implemented in C++ templates.

I did this small project mostly to self-learn and fiddle with templates.

Data structures implemented: simple Binary search tree, hash table, vector (dyamic array) and a Red Black search tree (only insert operatoion implemented).
